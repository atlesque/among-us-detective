      Hi, I'm Alex, also known as Atlesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for using this tool. I initially made it to help myself remember
      things while playing, but decided to release it for free so other people
      could enjoy it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There has been some controversy about whether this tool is a hack or a way
      of cheating.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me start by sincerely apologizing for giving you the wrong impression:
      I never intended to create anything that would ruin the game for anyone.
      After all, Among Us is a fantastic game that deserves great players like
      yourself!
    </p>

    <p>
      But I do understand why you might think this gives you an unfair
      advantage. The fact is: this <i>is</i> an external tool that let's you do
      things the game does not normally permit, like taking notes. So yes, it
      <i>does</i> get awfully close to cheat territory!
    </p>

    <p>
      However, from a technical point of view, this tool does not alter anything
      in the game. Unlike a hack which modifies the game client or a glitch
      which abuses the game's mechanics, this tool only allows you to keep track
      of things you've seen during your game. Therefor it is completely safe,
      legal and will <b>not</b> get you banned.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, it is nothing more than a "smart" notepad. You could also use pen
      and paper, or Excel, to create the exact same thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Does it spoil the fun for others? Let's consider: Does it really matter
      that you are confident in who/what you saw, if your crew doesn't believe
      you?
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest challenge of this game is not memorizing things, but
      convincing others you are right.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your crew doesn't believe you, it doesn't matter if you have perfect
      memory, no one will vote with you. And unfortunately, there is not tool
      for convincing people yet ðŸ™‚
    </p>

    <p>
      For the people like me that have a bad visual memory or are just starting
      out, this tool has proven to be quite a helpful little aid. For us, this
      tool has brought back the fun to this game by giving us more confidence in
      what we see and being able to focus more on other gameplay mechanics.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're still convinced this tool is in violation of any rules, policies
      or legal agreements, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me through
      email: <a href="mailto:alexander@atlesque.com">alexander@atlesque.com</a>.
      I promise I will take any inquiry seriously and take appropriate action if
      necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      For everyone else, I really hope you enjoy this tool and the game, and if
      you have any feedback or suggestions, you're always most welcome to get in
      touch! A lot of feature suggestions have come from users like yourself,
      and I heartily appreciate it.
    </p>

    <p>With metta</p>
